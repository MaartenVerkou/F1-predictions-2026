    <h2><%= t('about_page.section_about') %></h2>
    <p>This website is an independent, community-driven Formula 1 season prediction game.</p>
    <p>
      Participants submit season-long predictions before the first race weekend begins. After the deadline, predictions are locked and
      cannot be changed. After the final race, results are calculated based on official season outcomes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The platform is a set-and-forget prediction challenge that rewards thoughtful forecasting rather than ongoing activity.
      The website exists purely for entertainment purposes.
